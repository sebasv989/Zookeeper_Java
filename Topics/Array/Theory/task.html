<h2>Array</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>When you need to process multiple objects of the same type, you can save them in an <strong>array</strong> and then process them together as a single unit. It is a very convenient approach if you know how many objects the program will process during runtime.</p><p>You may consider an array as a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3770" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A collection in Java is a data structure that can hold multiple elements, providing a way to store, retrieve, and manipulate those elements efficiently. | It is part of the Java Collection Framework, which includes interfaces and classes for commonly used data structures such as lists, sets, and queues.
