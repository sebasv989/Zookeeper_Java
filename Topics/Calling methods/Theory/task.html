<h2>Calling methods</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>You may remember that a method is a <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3521" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A sequence in Java refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program. | It is the most common and straightforward sequence of statements, where each statement is executed in the order it is written, from top to bottom. This sequential flow is the foundation of Java programming, allowing for the execution of one action after another.">sequence</a> of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a statement is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It is a complete instruction that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Statements are often used to declare variables, assign values, control the flow of a program, or call methods. They are typically terminated by a semicolon (;) and can be organized into blocks to define the scope and visibility of variables and methods. Understanding statements is crucial for writing clear and concise Java code.">statements</a> that can be <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/7762" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, invoke means to execute a specific set of code within a method. | It involves using the method's name and providing the necessary arguments, if any. When a method is invoked, the program's control is transferred to the method's code, allowing it to perform its intended operation. Invoking a method promotes code reusability and modularity, making the code more organized, maintainable, and easier to understand.">invoked</a> or referred to by its name. Nothing special, huh? But what if we tell you that you can use it in a program anytime you need and anywhere you want just by invoking it with one line of code? Hope that we have caught your attention now!</p><p>To get started, we will <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3550" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, call is a term used to describe the process of invoking or executing a method, constructor, or function. | This action can be initiated from within another method, constructor, or function, and it allows for the sharing and reuse of code. The call can be made using different access modifiers, such as public, private, or protected, which determine where the call can be made from. Additionally, calls can be made using various types of parameters, including primitive types, objects, and arrays, which are passed to the method, constructor, or function being called.">call</a> any method:</p><pre><code class="language-java">getVolume(a, b, h);</code></pre><p>Here, <code class="language-java">getVolume</code> is the name of the method that, for example, calculates a volume of some geometric shape, and the variables <code class="language-java">a</code>, <code class="language-java">b</code> and <code class="language-java">h</code> are its <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10088" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a parameter is a variable that is used within a method to receive a value that is passed to the method when it is invoked. | The parameter definition includes the type, number, and order of the parameters, which reflects how they will be passed to the method. A method may have a parameterized argument and return type, and the class provides methods to examine the return type or argument of the method. The parameter of a method is a value that is used inside the method, and it is declared in the parentheses following the method name.">parameters</a>. Technically, the parameter of a method is some value that is used inside the method. The combination of the name and method parameters in parentheses is the way we call or invoke the method. Let's focus on it in more detail.</p><h5 id="what-is-calling-a-method">What is calling a method</h5><p>Let's say that there exists a method, that calculates a volume of a box:</p><pre><code class="language-java">static void calculateVolume(int length, int width, int height) {
    int volume = length * width * height;
    System.out.println(volume);
}</code></pre><p>Don't worry, for now, you don't need to fully understand the entire code. That's called a method <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Declaration in Java is the process of defining a variable, method, or class by specifying its name, type, and other attributes. | When declaring a variable, you specify its data type and name, and optionally initialize it with a value. Declaring a variable with a specific type can be lengthy and difficult to read, but starting from Java 10, you can use the var keyword instead of a specific type to force automatic type inference based on the type of assigned value.">declaration</a> and will be discussed in further topics. However, for a more detailed understanding let's break it down:</p><ul><li><p>The method is called <code class="language-java">calculateVolume</code>, and we'll use this name when we want to <strong>call</strong> it later.</p></li><li><p>The part in parentheses is where we declare some <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3518" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their values can be accessed and modified throughout the program.">variables</a> that the method will use in its code, we set the values for these variables when we <strong>call</strong> a method. In example above there are three of them: length, width and height of a box.</p></li><li><p>The code inside curly brackets is a sequence of statements that will be executed when we <strong>call</strong> this method. In the example it just multiplies three values passed as parameters and prints the result.</p></li></ul><p>If you want to call (or invoke) a method in your program, you should write its name and pass the values of its parameters in parentheses. Here's how it can be done:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        calculateVolume(3, 7, 2);
    }

    static void calculateVolume(int length, int width, int height) {
        int volume = length * width * height;
        System.out.println("The volume of a box is equal to " + volume);
    }
}</code></pre><p>Here we call a <code class="language-java">calculateVolume</code> method with three parameters: <strong>3</strong>, <strong>7</strong> and <strong>2. </strong>This basically means that the <code class="language-java">length</code>, <code class="language-java">width</code>, and <code class="language-java">height</code> variables are set to these values respectively. Next, the code within the curly brackets is executed, calculating the volume and printing the result. Therefore, the execution of the whole program <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9955" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the term result typically refers to the output or value produced by a method or function after it has completed its execution. | This result can be of any data type, including primitive types like int, float, or boolean, or reference types like arrays or objects. The result is usually returned to the caller of the method or function using the return statement. It's important to note that not all methods or functions in Java have a result, as some are designed to perform a specific action or modify an object's state without producing a value.">results</a> in the following output:</p><pre><code class="language-java">The volume of a box is equal to 42</code></pre><p>That said, to call a method means to instruct the program to <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, execute is a term often used in the context of running a piece of code or a method. | It refers to the process of starting the execution of a method, which contains a set of instructions that are carried out in order. This can include executing SQL statements, performing calculations, or any other action that a method is designed to do. The result of the execution can then be processed or returned as needed.">execute</a> a specific set of code within that method. It involves using the method's name and providing the necessary <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12877" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an argument is a value that is passed to a method when it is invoked. | It is a way to provide input to a method, allowing it to perform specific tasks based on the provided data. Arguments can be of any data type, including primitive types (like int, char, boolean) or reference types (like String, Array, or custom objects). When a method is defined, it specifies the types and number of arguments it expects, which are known as the method's parameter list.">arguments</a>.</p><h5 id="invoking-a-method-with-different-parameters">Invoking a method with different parameters</h5><p>Since the method we're calling (or invoking) depends on the passed parameters, if we pass other values to it, the result of the program will also change:</p><pre><code class="language-java">public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        calculateVolume(3, 7, 2); // The volume of a box is equal to 42
        calculateVolume(14, 6, 8); // The volume of a box is equal to 672
        calculateVolume(2, 2, 2); // The volume of a box is equal to 8
    }

    static void calculateVolume(int length, int width, int height) {
        int volume = length * width * height;
        System.out.println("The volume of a box is equal to " + volume);
    }
}</code></pre><p>However, when calling a function you should always provide the correct number and types of arguments that the function expects. That said, the following calls will produce a compile error:</p><ul><li><p><code class="language-java">calculateVolume(1, 2);</code></p></li><li><p><code class="language-java">calculateVolume("Hello", true, 6);</code></p></li></ul><p>Let's say there is another method that takes a student's name, age, and average score as parameters and prints them:</p><pre><code class="language-java">static void printStudent(String name, double averageScore) {
    System.out.println("Name: " + name);
    System.out.println("Average score: " + averageScore);
}</code></pre><p>In this case, the method expects us to pass two values of different types. Therefore, the correct usage example of this method will be:</p><pre><code class="language-java">printStudent("John", 3.14); 
// Name: John
// Average score: 3.14</code></pre><p>Not all methods expect any parameters; some are designed to operate without any provided data. When invoking such methods, you don't need to provide any arguments, so just leave the parentheses empty as follows: <code class="language-java">doSomething()</code>.</p><h5 id="different-ways">Different ways</h5><p>Some methods are called in a slightly different ways. Let's take a look at some of them.</p><p>To call a method from outside the class it belongs to, you need to indicate a class as a prefix. Check these methods:</p><pre><code class="language-java">Math.round(79.378); // method with Math class name
Character.isLetter('a'); // method with Character class name</code></pre><p>Let's try to perform a small task by invoking a method:</p><pre><code class="language-java">double weight = 63.85;
weight = Math.round(weight); // now weight equals 64.0</code></pre><p>Methods that operate on specific instances are called <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3495" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An instance method in Java is a type of method that is associated with a specific instance or object of a class, and can access and modify the state of that object through its instance variables. | It is defined within a class, but outside of any other method, and is invoked using the dot notation on an object reference. Instance methods can also be overridden in subclasses to provide different behavior for different types of objects.">instance methods</a>. Methods like this require an object to be invoked. Take a look:</p><pre><code class="language-java">String s = "HellO, WoRlD!";
s = s.toLowerCase(); // hello, world!</code></pre><p>Before we called the  <code class="language-java">toLowerCase()</code> method, we created an object of the <code class="language-java">String</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a 'type' refers to a classification of data that determines the values it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | This can include primitive types (such as int, char, or boolean) and reference types (such as classes, interfaces, or arrays). Each type has a specific size and range of values it can represent, and the operations that can be performed on it are defined by the language. Understanding the different types in Java is essential for writing correct and efficient code, as well as for understanding the behavior of existing code.">type</a> called <code class="language-java">s</code>, since the method in question deals with <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A string in Java is a reference type consisting of characters, and it is one of the most widely used types in Java. | Strings are immutable, meaning their characters cannot be changed once created. They have methods for getting individual characters and extracting substrings, and they work with text, whether it's a simple hello, world! or a complex document. Strings are everywhere in Java code, and understanding how to use them effectively is fundamental for any Java developer.">strings</a>. Now we can call the method for this particular instance<em>, </em>which results in decapitalizing all the letters from our string. </p><p>As you see, this method requires an instance to be created before it can be called, that's why it is known as an <strong>instance method</strong>. We will talk about this type of method later.</p><h5 id="built-in-methods">Built-in methods</h5><p>Why do you need to rewrite algorithms that have already been written? Of course, we're not talking about some special cases like educational tasks. Still, it is more efficient to use pre-defined methods that are always available to the user. That is why there are two types of methods in Java: <strong>built-in</strong> and <strong>user-defined </strong>methods.</p><p><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/10982" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A built-in method in Java is a pre-defined function that is part of the standard Java library, which means it is available for use in any Java program without the need for separate implementation. | These methods are designed to perform specific tasks, such as mathematical calculations, string manipulation, or input/output operations. By using built-in methods, programmers can avoid writing repetitive code and improve the efficiency and readability of their programs. The number of built-in methods is constantly growing, and they can be found in the Oracle documentation.">Built-in methods</a> belong to the Standard Java <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3770" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A library in Java is a pre-written set of classes, interfaces, and methods that provide reusable functionality for developers. | It is a collection of code that can be utilized across multiple applications, saving developers time and effort. Libraries can be part of the Java Standard Library or third-party libraries. They help standardize common tasks, such as network communication, file I/O, or database access, and promote code reusability and best practices. By using libraries, developers can focus on the unique aspects of their applications, rather than reinventing the wheel.">library</a>. Now there are a lot of built-in methods that convert or compare values, round doubles, find the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12877" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the maximum of two numbers can be determined using the `Math.max()` method, which is a built-in method in the `Math` class of the Java standard library. | This method takes two double-precision floating-point numbers as arguments and returns the larger of the two.

We've already dealt with the <code class="language-java">round()</code> and <code class="language-java">isLetter()</code> methods, but the number of built-in methods is huge and constantly growing. You can find the method you need in the Oracle documentation. For example, check out the link to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Math library</a>.</p><p>In contrast to built-in methods, user-defined methods are created by the programmer. It is a common practice to create a customized subprogram for a specific purpose. Later on, we will learn why it is a good practice to use user-defined methods and how to actually create them. </p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Generally, a method is a necessary tool for a programmer who is aiming for a neat and reusable code style. With the help of methods, you can perform any specific task you need. They make the program look more readable, and you don't need to repeat routine code lines over and over. Some tasks are wrapped in special built-in methods that are part of the standard Java library. Also, there are user-defined methods that are created by the programmer. We will discuss these methods in other topics. </p>
